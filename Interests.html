<h2>Glacier National Park</h1>

<img src= "GlacierPark.jpg" width = "500">

<p>One of the nicest national parks in the U.S. is located just up north in the state of Montana and it is known as Glacier National Park.<br> Located in the Rocky Mountains, this national park is home to over 700 miles of hiking trails, as well as access to the elusive<em> Hidden Lake</em>. <br>This is one of the many places that I like to visit and go hiking at!</p>
